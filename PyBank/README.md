Financial Analysis 

This Python script analyzes financial records from a CSV file named budget_data.csv. It calculates various financial metrics and provides a summary of the analysis.

To run the script and analyze the financial data:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
2. Place the budget_data.csv file in the same directory as the Python scrip or specify the correct path to the file
3. Run the script using the command: python main.py

The script dispays the financial analysis on the terminal and exports the results to a file named financial_analysis.txt
